node type appears in this view's position. When you set this to
true, it will be called for any node, making it possible to have
a node view that representsmultiple types of nodes. You will
need to check the type of the nodes you get in <code>update</code> and
return <code>false</code> for types you cannot handle. -> {"error":{"code":"Forbidden","message":"Your resource has been temporarily blocked because we detected behavior that may violate our content policy.

[undefined-/home/runner/work/prosemirror-cn-website/prosemirror-cn-website/website/public/docs/ref/index.html]: When given, this will be called when the view is updating
itself. It will be given a node, an array of active decorations
around the node (which are automatically drawn, and the node
view may ignore if it isn't interested in them), and a
<a href="#view.DecorationSource">decoration source</a> that represents any
decorations that apply to the content of the node (which again
may be ignored). It should return true if it was able to update
to that node, and false otherwise. If the node view has a
<code>contentDOM</code> property (or no <code>dom</code> property), updating its child
nodes will be handled by ProseMirror. -> {"error":{"code":"Forbidden","message":"Your resource has been temporarily blocked because we detected behavior that may violate our content policy. For more details on Azure OpenAI service content policy, please visit https://aka.ms/aoaicodeofconduct"}}
